                        <p xmlns="">In fact, since its introduction in the 1920s, Mobil Delvac has played a critical and ever-growing role across trucking, agriculture, mining, construction, rail and more.<br>
The common thread linking this wide array of businesses and industries is service: Companies, contractors, fleet operators, farmers, owner/operators &ndash; in one way or another, they all exist to serve customers. And with Mobil Delvac heavy-duty lubricants helping to keep businesses running smoothly, their customers can receive more reliable, dependable service.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">Happy customers help businesses grow. That simple formula for success is why so many decision-makers, across so many industries, choose the Mobil Delvac brand.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Boosting business success</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p xmlns="">The Mobil Delvac product range has established benchmarks for performance, protection and fuel economy that have helped fleet businesses get the most out of their vehicles.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">To drive operational efficiencies further and help you better achieve your business goals, we&rsquo;re continually developing new, cutting-edge support services.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">As a result, the intelligent, effective management programs and tools we offer today do more than ever to keep your fleet rolling at peak performance.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Fleet profile and Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) analysis</strong>, for example, provides you with a customized analysis of your fleet to determine the right lubrication solutions for your unique needs &ndash; helping reduce your total cost of ownership.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">Crucially, it can show you how Mobil Delvac-branded lubricants and tools can deliver that improvement by extending drain intervals, improving engine efficiency, reducing maintenance costs and cutting fuel expenses, ultimately achieving lower overall operating costs for your business.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

                        <p xmlns="">Designed to make an equally valuable contribution to the success of our business partners by ensuring equipment reliability/durability and reducing costs is our <strong>Mobil Serv Lubricant Analysis</strong>.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">Tailored to monitor critical indicators in used oil, based on leading equipment builder specifications and international standards, this rigorous analysis enables you to better understand the condition of your lubricants and equipment.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">The program also offers convenient online access and features to help you get the most out of your analysis.<br>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Proof of a smart decision</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p xmlns="">With 12,000-plus vehicles on the road every day, Schneider National is one of the largest transportation and logistics carriers in the USA. After a two-year battery of tests to find a premium engine oil with the upgraded protection for their iconic orange trucks, the company switched its fleet to Mobil Delvac.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">While Mobil Delvac heavy-duty oil was the clear winner in the rigorous trials, the ultimate decision to change the fleet&rsquo;s engine oil went well beyond performance considerations.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">An important factor in the decision was the level of support Schneider National would get from the motor oil brand. In this aspect, too, the Mobil Delvac brand prevailed. Steve Jarosinski, manager of tractor engineering, says, &ldquo;We received exceptional support from the field service engineering team and technical experts with ExxonMobil. When we evaluated the entire offer in terms of product performance and the technical support that the ExxonMobil team provides to its fleet customers, it was clear that choosing Mobil Delvac Elite would be the right choice.&rdquo;</p>

                        <p xmlns="">It&rsquo;s a choice that has already paid off for Schneider National in many ways. And looking ahead, Jarosinski anticipates even greater success. &ldquo;While we are generating substantial benefits today working with ExxonMobil and using Mobil Delvac Elite, we know that the technology leadership behind Mobil Delvac- branded lubricants and the support of ExxonMobil will help push us to get even better in the future.&rdquo;<br>
