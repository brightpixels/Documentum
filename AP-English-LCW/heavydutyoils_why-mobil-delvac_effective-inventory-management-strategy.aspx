                            <img src="../AP-English-LCW/Images/article_150x150_fleet-inventory-management.jpg" height="150" width="150" alt="Five Key Factors for Maintaining An Efficient Inventory Management Strategy" title="Five Key Factors for Maintaining An Efficient Inventory Management Strategy" align="left" border="0" hspace="0" class="imgFloatLeft">Maintaining an efficient inventory management strategy is a valuable way for fleet managers to save money and time. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
When addressing inventory management, there are several major factors fleet managers must consider.&nbsp; Perhaps the most important is recognizing that inventory costs extend well beyond the initial purchase price of materials.&nbsp; Other factors to consider include additional costs for handling and storage, different types of stock, accurately estimating the replenishment quantity, and predicting the appropriate timing to reorder.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
Furthermore, the effort and sophistication needed for a successful inventory strategy should be balanced with the size, complexity and most importantly, the cost of the inventory to be handled. Here are five of the most important factors that fleet managers should consider when developing or recreating their inventory management plans.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Carrying Costs<br>
                            </strong>Let&rsquo;s say a fleet typically has 100 containers of oil or grease in inventory at $200 per container. One would think that the inventory cost would be $20,000. But it&rsquo;s not. Additional carrying costs will actually drive the total cost of purchasing and maintaining this inventory closer to $25,000 or $30,000.</p>
                        <p>Carrying costs are associated with holding or &ldquo;carrying&rdquo; inventories over time. In other words, the fleet has to pay more money on top of the purchase price of the product for things such as storage, insurance, extra equipment and personnel.</p>
                        <p>For fleets of any size, one must factor in additional expenses for such items as forms, clerical support, processing, borrowing and taxes. While the carrying costs will vary with specific situations, they are often estimated, conservatively, at 18 to 25 percent above the value of the inventory.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Inventory Management</strong>
                            <br>
Beyond the additional carrying costs cited above, having excess inventory could result in other inconveniences, especially for small fleets, which typically have limited storage capacity for excess inventory. Storing excess inventory can drive up costs and the additional inventory can take up valuable space needed for vehicle maintenance.</p>
                        <p>Furthermore, small fleets also tend to have a smaller staff and often rely on one person to handle necessary and time-consuming day-to-day activities, such as accounting, data processing and ordering. In this case, it is important for a small fleet to accurately manage the inventory overflow to keep inventory levels where they are supposed to be and to keep employee productivity at its most efficient level.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Understanding Your Stock</strong>
                            <br>
Another factor impacting the efficiency of one&rsquo;s inventory management strategy is the role of the inventory. Inventory is composed of two separate stocks -- working stock and safety stock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>Working stock supports day-to-day operations and will continuously cycle up and down as the material is consumed and replenished.</p>
                        <p>Safety stock is to be used as protection against material shortages caused by unexpected events, such as delayed replenishment or an unusually high consumption rate. Under ideal operating conditions, safety stock is not used.</p>
                        <p>However, since operating conditions for any business are not always ideal, one should regard safety stock like the insurance policy on one&rsquo;s car &ndash; you hope you&rsquo;ll never have to use it, but it would be very risky to be without it.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Replenishment Quantity</strong>
                            <br>
How much should a fleet buy when replenishing inventory? The most economic replenishment quantity, commonly called the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity), represents the lowest total sum cost of total inventory and inventory acquisition costs (order placement costs, invoice processing costs, payables costs, freight, etc.). Large replenishment quantities translate into fewer replenishment orders but larger inventories. Small replenishment quantities will reduce inventories but will increase the number of replenishment orders needed.</p>
                        <p>The EOQ is a function of the consumption rate, carrying cost, inventory value and inventory acquisition costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Reorder Point</strong>
                            <br>
The appropriate time to reorder inventory can be determined by how quickly the inventory is being consumed and the order lead time designated by the supplier. For example, if a fleet consumes 10 gallons of oil per day and it takes five days to receive material from the supplier, reordering should take place when the working stock gets down to 50 gallons. If the fleet's inventory management system is working to maximum efficiency, one&rsquo;s working stock will get to zero gallons as the replenishment arrives.</p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Inventory Cost Reduction Opportunities</strong>
                            <br>
Reducing inventory and related total inventory costs do not always go hand-in-hand. Beyond the tips provided above, how can fleets further trim inventory costs without the risk of running out of necessary materials?&nbsp; First, and perhaps the most basic element in reducing costs, is to work with supplier(s) to shorten cycle order fulfilment times and minimise the need for excess safety stock.</p>
                        <p>Another area in which one can achieve cost savings is through product consolidations. Multiple individual safety stocks can be combined into one typically smaller safety stock. Consumption rates for consolidated products are higher, making smaller order quantities more economical. The higher consumption rates are also typically more rateable, which can translate into further safety stock reductions with no increased risk of runouts.</p>
                        <p>For any fleet, an efficient inventory management strategy can play a key role in driving cost savings and productivity enhancements. By paying close attention to the key factors mentioned above, fleet managers can build and sustain an efficient inventory management system.</p>
