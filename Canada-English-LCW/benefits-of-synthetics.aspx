                        <h1>Why choose synthetics?</h1>
                        <p xmlns="">Synthetic lubricants such as Mobil 1&trade; can provide a variety of benefits that help keep your equipment running at optimal performance for years to come. To understand synthetic oils, let&rsquo;s look first at the origins of all oils, particularly motor oils. Conventional oils come from crude oil that is pumped from the ground. Crude oil is made up of a complex mixture of molecules that form chains and rings of different sizes and shapes. Long chains of carbon atoms produce a thick, viscous fluid that flows slowly. Shorter chains produce fluid that flows more readily.</p>

                        <p xmlns="" align="center">
                            <img src="../Shared-Images-LCW/article_400x514_benefits-of-synthetics_amer_en.jpg" height="514" width="400" alt="Benefits of Synthetics" title="Benefits of Synthetics" border="0" hspace="0"></p>

                        <p xmlns="">In an oil refinery, crude oil is separated into various fractions. These become the basis for lubricating oils and fuels. Thick tangled masses of carbon chains become asphaltic materials used in roofing tar and roadwork. Very short chains and ring compounds of carbon are volatile and can be refined to produce gasoline and other products. All motor oils are made up of base oils and additives. In general, fully synthetic motor oils contain non-conventional, high-performance fluids. Synthetic blends usually use some non-conventional, high-performance fluids in combination with conventional oil.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">To meet the demanding requirements of today's specifications (and our customers' expectations),&nbsp;Mobil 1 uses high-performance fluids, including polyalphaolefins (PAOs), along with a proprietary system of additives.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p xmlns="">Each Mobil 1 viscosity grade uses a unique combination of synthetic fluids and selected additives in order to tailor the viscosity grade to its specific application.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">Imperial Oil offers a wide range of synthetic lubricants, from compressor oils to greases, that can help meet the critical or severe needs of your equipment.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>What Can Synthetics Do for You?</strong>&nbsp;<br>

                            <br>
Synthetic lubricants:</p>

                        <ul xmlns="">
    
                            <li>Work where mineral oils reach their limits&nbsp;</li>
    
                            <li>Solve specific lubrication problems (e.g. to enable an under-designed machine to operate properly)&nbsp;</li>
    
                            <li>Provide enhanced cost and/or performance (e.g. longer drain intervals and less downtime)&nbsp;</li>

                        </ul>

                        <p xmlns="">Key factors in your decision are the severity of service, any special requirements and safety or environmental concerns. Imperial Oil's line of synthetic lubricants, marketed mainly under the Mobil&trade; brand, can provide:</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Longer oil drains&nbsp;<br>

                            </strong>Thanks to their superior oxidation stability, synthetic oils can last considerably longer than mineral lubricants. You'll spend less time changing lubricants and money on used-oil disposal. Oxidation stability also reduces the risk of harmful deposits on components. That means fewer shutdowns for equipment maintenance and cleaning - a plus for your production.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Energy savings</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Compared to mineral oils, whose molecules come in assorted shapes and sizes, synthetic-oil molecules are relatively uniform. When they move against each other, it creates less heat and friction. The cooler operating temperature is easier on oil and equipment. Reducing friction can also significantly save energy, further easing your costs of operation.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Severe-service protection</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Synthetics are ideal for applications involving shock loads or other severe conditions. Unlike mineral oils, which often fail to stand up against extreme pressure, synthetics retain their structure - along with their ability to lubricate and guard against wear. That can save labor, lubricant and equipment - and lower the risk of lost protection due to breakdown.</p>

                        <p xmlns="">
                            <strong>Safe operation in temperature extremes</strong>&nbsp;<br>
Synthetic oils are free of wax, which can solidify at low temperatures and make mineral oils resistant to flow.&nbsp; Extreme heat? Synthetics resist the oxidation that causes some oils to leave deposits. That can save you money on repairs and keep your production running smoothly.</p>
